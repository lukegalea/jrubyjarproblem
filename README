To reproduce problem: 
  warble jar

This will generate a jar.

Run it via java -jar jrubyjarproblem.jar

So far I have tested on two different OSX machines both running JDK 1.6.0_24, one works.. the other does not.
One has XCode installed (the one that works), but other than that I can't see a difference between the two.
It certainly doesn't work on windows JRE 1.6.0_25 nor JDK 1.6.0_14
